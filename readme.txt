DHL Label Creator to create shipping labels per one click in woocommerce

== Description ==

This plugin enables a feature for you to print your DHL shipping labels directly from wordpress. If someone makes a order in your woocommerce shop, you can now create a DHL label at orderDetails 
 to ship your products. Very simple, with only one button to press at your orderDetails menu. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wu-dhl` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->DHL Manager screen to configure the plugin
4. Configure all datas needed on the configuration screen
5. Use the button in the Order Detail Screen

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Why can't I print my label? =

Check your configuration, one misspelled letter or wrong number would crash the connection to the DHL server.

= Why is there the word MUSTER on my sample Print/Sandbox? =

If you use a Sample print or a Sandbox print it is totaly free, but DHL only gives back a pattern of how it could look after being printed. 

= If I create a label can I delete it? =

At the moment you can only delete it in your Database. There will come an update to fix this matter, so you can easily delete it per button click. 

= Why are there no retour labels? =

We are already testing this feature, so we can update the plugin as soon as possible, so retour labels can be printed.
